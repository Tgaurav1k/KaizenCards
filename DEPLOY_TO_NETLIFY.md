# 🚀 Deploy Kaizen Cards to Netlify - Step by Step Guide

Your project is now on GitHub: https://github.com/Tgaurav1k/KaizenCards

## 📋 Quick Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create Netlify Account (if needed)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Sign up with GitHub (recommended) or email
3. Complete verification

### Step 2: Import Your Project
1. **Click "Add new site"** button (top right)
2. **Select "Import an existing project"**
3. **Choose "Deploy with GitHub"** (or GitLab/Bitbucket if using those)
4. **Authorize Netlify** to access your GitHub repositories
5. **Select your repository:** `Tgaurav1k/KaizenCards`

### Step 3: Configure Build Settings
Netlify will auto-detect these settings from `netlify.toml`:
- ✅ **Build command:** `npm run build`
- ✅ **Publish directory:** `build`
- ✅ **Node version:** 18 (auto-selected)

**Verify these settings are correct:**
- In the deploy settings, you should see:
  - Base directory: `/` (leave empty)
  - Build command: `npm run build`
  - Publish directory: `build`

### Step 4: Deploy!
1. Click **"Deploy site"** button
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for the build to complete
3. Your site will be live! 🎉

### Step 5: Your Live Site
- Your site will be available at: `https://your-random-name.netlify.app`
- Netlify will automatically assign a name, or you can customize it later

## 🔧 Configuration Details

Your project already has these files configured:

### ✅ `netlify.toml`
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "build"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### ✅ `public/_redirects`
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

These ensure React Router works correctly (routes like `/privacy-policy`, `/return-policy`, etc.)

---

## 🎨 Customize Your Site Name

1. Go to **Site settings** → **Change site name**
2. Enter a custom name (e.g., `kaizen-cards`)
3. Your site will be: `https://kaizen-cards.netlify.app`

---

## 🌐 Add Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to **Site settings** → **Domain management**
2. Click **"Add custom domain"**
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `kaizencards.com`)
4. Follow DNS configuration instructions
5. Netlify provides free SSL/HTTPS automatically

---

## 📱 Auto-Deployment

**Good news!** Netlify automatically:
- ✅ Deploys on every push to `main` branch
- ✅ Creates preview deployments for pull requests
- ✅ Runs builds automatically
- ✅ Provides deployment notifications

### Test Auto-Deployment
```bash
# Make a small change
git add .
git commit -m "Test auto-deploy"
git push origin main
```

Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy! 🚀

---

## 🔍 Verify Your Deployment

After deployment, check:

1. **Homepage loads:** `https://your-site.netlify.app`
2. **React Router works:**
   - `/privacy-policy`
   - `/return-policy`
   - `/shipping-info`
3. **Images load:** All images in `public/images/` should display
4. **Mobile responsive:** Test on mobile devices
5. **All features work:**
   - Carousel
   - Image gallery
   - FAQ accordion
   - Scroll animations

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- **Check build logs** in Netlify dashboard
- **Test locally:** Run `npm run build` to see errors
- **Common issues:**
  - Missing dependencies → Check `package.json`
  - Syntax errors → Check build logs
  - Large files → Optimize images

### Routes Don't Work
- **Check `_redirects` file** is in `public/` folder
- **Verify `netlify.toml`** has redirect rules
- **Clear cache** and redeploy

### Images Not Loading
- **Verify images** are in `public/images/`
- **Check paths** use `/images/` not `./images/`
- **Clear browser cache**

### Build Takes Too Long
- **Optimize images** before committing
- **Check build logs** for warnings
- **Consider using Netlify's image optimization**

## 📊 Monitor Your Site

### Netlify Dashboard Features:
- 📈 **Analytics** - View visitor stats
- 🔔 **Deploy notifications** - Email/Slack notifications
- 🛠️ **Functions** - Serverless functions (if needed)

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables (if needed later)

If you need to add environment variables:
1. Go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
2. Add variable name and value
3. Click **Save**
4. Redeploy site (or auto-deploys on next push)
